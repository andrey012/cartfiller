# Tutorial

This folder contains examples. These examples are live - it is actually a testsuite, that works (and is built on CI). 

Start reading from [cartfiller.js](cartfiller.js) and then proceed to [testScenarioFeatures](testScenarioFeatures) and [workers](workers) folders.

Just read files one by one, they are full of comments.

When looking at workers folder you may want to check [browserActionsAkaWorkersFeatures/workersDemo.js](browserActionsAkaWorkersFeatures/workersDemo.js) just to understand how particular browser actions are used.

Working demo of this testsuite can be found [here](http://andrey012.github.io/cartfiller/dist/index.ga.html#root=https://andrey012.github.io/cartfiller/tutorial)
